# Molecule-Web-Server-Application

## Description üìÑ
This is my first full-stack web development project that exposes me to Agile software development. This web application allows user
to insert elements and parse SDF files for molecules into a database. This web application also has the functionality to generate and displays an SVG image of the molecule.

## Development ü™ú
- Developed a C library and implemented SWIG to generate a Python wrapper for the library.
- Used Python to develop the functionality of parsing an SDF files, inserting elements and molecules into an SQLite database, and generating an SVG image for the molecule.
- Used HTML/CSS and JQuery to communicate and send data from the client-side to a Python web server.

## Running the program üèÉ
- Download python and SWIG if not yet available in your system
- Enter in command line:   
```
make  
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=.  
python3 server 8000  
```
- Open a browser and enter: http://localhost:8000/index.html

Side note: makefile may need modifications to fit each individual's system
